# VoxelViewer
A simple gui tool for loading voxel models from CSV and viewing 2D slices of them.

## Obtaining CSV Voxel Models
You can obtain a voxel CSV file from a regular model file (OBJ, STL, etc...) using [Voxelizer](https://drububu.com/miscellaneous/voxelizer/?out=txt), by choosing the `.txt` output format.
